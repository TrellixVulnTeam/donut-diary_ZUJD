# Donut Diary

Donut Diary is a donut review site built using customized WordPress child theme that features a custom Gutenberg block.

## Child Theme Customization
Donut Diary WordPress theme was built by customizing the Twenty-Twenty-One theme. To round out the child theme, I added a custom post type - Donut and added logic to the child's function.php file to display Donut post types and regular Post types together.


## Custom Gutenberg Block
I configured my build environment with Webpack, Babel, and React. The custom block input the text field areas to build a donut review. Then I enqueue the files and register the custom block.

## Site Design 
I chose the Twenty Twenty-One theme because its open and airy layout style lent itself well to food photography.
